Ingredients

1 and 1/3 cups (320ml) warm water (between 100-110°F, 38-43°C)
2 and 1/4 teaspoons Red Star Platinum instant yeast
 (1 standard packet)*
1 Tablespoon (13g) granulated sugar
2 Tablespoons (30ml) olive oil
3/4 teaspoon salt
3 and 1/2 cups (438g) all-purpose flour (spoon and leveled),
 plus more for hands and surface
sprinkle of cornmeal for dusting the pan
Instructions

Whisk the warm water,
 yeast, and granulated sugar together in the bowl of your
 stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. 
Cover and allow to rest for 5 minutes. 
*If you don’t have a stand mixer, 
simply use a large mixing bowl and mix the dough with
 a wooden spoon or rubber spatula in the next step.
Add the olive oil, salt, and flour.
 Beat on low speed for 2 minutes. 
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.
 With lightly floured hands,
 knead the dough for 3-4 minutes (for a visual, 
watch me do it in the video above!).
 The dough can be a little too heavy for a mixer to knead it,
 but you can certainly use the mixer on low speed instead. 
After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. 
Poke it with your finger – if it slowly bounces back, 
your dough is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading.
Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick 
spray– just use the same bowl you used for the dough.
 Place the dough in the bowl,
 turning it to coat all sides in the oil. 
Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, 
or a clean kitchen towel. 
Allow the dough to rise at room temperature
 for 60-90 minutes or until double in size. 
(Tip: For the warm environment on a particularly cold day, 
heat your oven to 150°F (66°C).
 Turn the oven off, place the dough inside, 
and keep the door slightly ajar.
 This will be a warm environment for your dough to rise. 
After about 30 minutes, close the oven door to trap
 the air inside with the rising dough.
 When it’s doubled in size, remove from the oven.)
Preheat oven to 475°F (246°C). 
Allow it to heat for at least 15-20 minutes as you
 shape the pizza.
 Lightly grease baking sheet or pizza pan with nonstick 
spray or olive oil.
 Sprinkle lightly with cornmeal,
 which gives the crust extra crunch and flavor. 
Highly recommended.
Shape the dough: When the dough is ready,
 punch it down to release any air bubbles.
 Divide the dough in half.
 (If not making 2 pizzas, freeze half of the dough
 for another time– see freezing instructions below.) 
On a lightly floured work surface using
 lightly floured hands or rolling pin, 
gently flatten the dough into a disc.
 Place on prepared pan and, using lightly floured hands, 
stretch and flatten the disc into a 12-inch circle.
 Lift the edge of the dough up to create a lip around the edges. 
I simply pinch the edges up to create the rim.
 If using a pizza stone,
 place the dough directly on baker’s peels dusted with cornmeal.
Cover dough lightly with plastic wrap or
 a clean kitchen towel and allow to rest for a few minutes as
 you prepare your pizza toppings.
 I suggest pepperoni , green peppers or jalapeño slices,
 extra cheese pizza, Hawaiian pizza, classic margherita pizza,
 spinach artichoke white pizza, or homemade BBQ chicken pizza.
Top , bake the pizza: To prevent 
the filling from making your pizza crust soggy,
 brush the top lightly with olive oil. 
Using your fingers, push dents into the
 surface of the dough to prevent bubbling.
 Top with your favorite toppings and bake
 for 12-15 minutes.
Slice hot pizza and serve immediately.
 Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator. 
Reheat as you prefer. Baked pizza 
slices can be frozen up to 3 months.

Ingredients
2 tablespoons plain (all-purpose) flour

600 g (1 lb 5 oz) chuck steak,
 cut into 1 cm (½ inch) pieces

60 ml (2 fl oz/¼ cup) olive oil

4 brown onions, thinly sliced

1 medium carrot, finely chopped

1 celery stalk, finely chopped

2 garlic cloves, crushed

1 teaspoon caster (superfine) sugar

125 ml (4 fl oz/½ cup) red wine

500 ml (17 fl oz/2 cups) beef stock

200 g (7 oz) Swiss brown mushrooms,
 trimmed and quartered

1 quantity shortcrust pastry

1 egg, lightly whisked

Method
1. Place the flour in a large bowl and
 season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.
 Add the beef,
 toss to coat in the flour and shake off any excess.

2. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in 
a large heavy-based flameproof 
casserole over medium-high heat. Add half the beef and cook, 
turning often, for 5 minutes or until browned all over. 
Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining beef,
 adding a little extra oil if necessary.

3. Heat half the remaining oil in the casserole.
 Add the onions, carrot and celery and cook over medium heat, 
stirring occasionally, for 10-12 minutes or until soft.
 Add the garlic and sugar and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds.

4. Add the wine and bring to the boil. 
Reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, 
for 2 minutes or until slightly reduced. 
Return the beef to the casserole with the stock.
 Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, 
covered, for 1 hour.
 Uncover and cook for a further 1 hour or until 
the meat is very tender and the liquid has thickened.

5. Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil
 in a frying pan over medium-high heat. 
Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring,
 for about 5 minutes or until browned all over. 
Add to the beef mixture and stir to combine. 
Transfer to a bowl and cool to room temperature.

6. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F/Gas 4). 
Divide the pastry into 2 portions, one twice as big as the other. 
Use a lightly floured rolling pin to 
roll out the smaller portion of pastry on 
a lightly floured work surface until 3 mm ( 1/8 inch) thick.
 Use the top of an 11 cm (4¼ inch) (top diameter),
 7.5 cm (3 inch) (base diameter) pie tin to cut 4
 rounds from the pastry.

7. Divide the larger portion of pastry into
 4 equal portions and roll each out on a 
lightly floured work surface,
 taking care not to overwork the dough or
 it will become too soft,
 into a 15 cm (6 inch) diameter round. 
Carefully ease each round into a pie tin,
 using your fingertips to press them into the base and side.
 Roll the rolling pin over the tops of
 the tins to trim the excess pastry.

8. Divide the beef mixture among the pastry-lined tins.
 Brush the top edges of the pastry with a little egg.
 Place the smaller pastry rounds on top to 
cover the beef mixture and use a lightly floured
 fork to press the edges together. 
Use a small sharp knife to make 2 slits in the top of each pastry lid.
 Brush the tops lightly with egg and bake for 40 minutes or until golden.
 Set aside for 10 minutes to cool slightly,
 then remove from the tins. Serve hot.

INGREDIENTS
1 tablespoon coarse salt
4 medium Idaho russet baking potatoes (about 1 1/2 pounds), 
peeled and quartered
6 scallions (white part only), finely minced
3 ounces Ecuadorean quesillo (available in specialty
 food markets) or Monterey Jack cheese, grated
½ teaspoon finely ground black pepper
¼ teaspoon fine salt
¼ cup achiote-infused corn oil (recipe follows)

PREPARATION
step 1
In a large saucepan combine 2 quarts of 
water with 1 tablespoon coarse salt,
 and bring to a boil. Add the potatoes,
 and boil until soft, about 15 minutes.
 Drain and mash the potatoes; then,
 add the scallions, 
cheese, salt and pepper, and mix well.

step2
Divide the puree into 12 balls
 -- about 3 tablespoons for each ball. 
Flatten the balls to form patties 3 inches
 wide by 1/2 inch thick.
 Allow the patties to cool 20 minutes, until firm. 
Unless the patties are firm enough, 
they will stick to the skillet.

step3
Brush large nonstick skillet with achiote-infused oil, 
and place over medium-low heat.
 Place patties on skillet without crowding them.
 Lightly brush each patty with achiote oil.
 Cook 3 to 5 minutes on each side to form a crust.
 Repeat with remaining patties. Serve hot.

Ingredient Checklist
1 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast
3 tablespoons warm water
 (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons white sugar
1 ½ teaspoons salt
⅔ cup warm milk
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
⅔ cup unsalted butter, chilled
1 egg
1 tablespoon water

DirectionsInstructions Checklist
Step 1
Combine yeast, 
warm water, 
and 1 teaspoon sugar.
 Allow to stand until creamy and frothy.

Step 2
Measure flour into a mixing bowl.
 Dissolve 2 teaspoons sugar and salt in warm milk. 
Blend into flour along with yeast and oil. 
Mix well; knead until smooth. 
Cover, and let rise until over triple in volume,
 about 3 hours.
 Deflate gently, and let rise again until doubled,
 about another 3 hours. Deflate and chill 20 minutes.

Step 3
Massage butter until pliable, but not soft and oily.
 Pat dough into a 14x8-inch rectangle. 
Smear butter over top two thirds, 
leaving 1/4-inch margin all around. 
Fold unbuttered third over middle third,
 and buttered top third down over that.
 Turn 90 degrees, so that folds are to left and right. 
Roll out to a 14x6-inch rectangle. Fold in three again.
 Sprinkle lightly with flour, and put dough in a plastic bag.
 Refrigerate 2 hours. Unwrap,
 sprinkle with flour, and deflate gently.
 Roll to a 14x6-inch rectangle,
 and fold again. Turn 90 degrees,
 and repeat. Wrap, and chill 2 hours.

Step 4
To shape, roll dough out to a 20x5-inch rectangle. Cut in half
 crosswise, and chill half while shaping the other half.
 Roll out to a 15 x 5 inch rectangle. Cut into three 5 x 5 
inch squares. Cut each square in half diagonally.
 Roll each triangle lightly to elongate
 the point, and make it 7 inches long. Grab the other 2 points, and stretch them out
 slightly as you roll it up. Place on a baking sheet, curving slightly. Let shaped
 croissants rise until puffy and light. In a small bowl, beat together egg and 1 
tablespoon water. Glaze croissants with egg wash.

Step 5
Bake in a preheated 475 degrees F (245 degrees C) oven for 12 to 15 minutes.
