    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <pre >
      16 ounce box penne pasta.*
      pound  ground beef.
      medium onion diced.

      Tablespoon  tomato paste.
      cups  of milk or a mixture of milk and broth. .**
      Tablespoon  flour.***

    1/4 cup of unsalted butter.****
    1/4 cup + 3 Tablespoons oil.****
    Salt and pepper to taste.
    Optional: an egg.
    Instructions
    Cook Pasta:
    Cook pasta according to package directions,
    try to make it a bit chewy as it will continue cooking 
    in the béchamel sauce in the oven.
    Drain and do not rinse. Add a tablespoon of oil to the
    pasta and stir to combine. 
    Check seasoning of the pasta, adding more salt and pepper
    if you like.
    Cook minced meat:
    In a pan over medium heat, add 2 tablespoon of oil, 
    then sauté onion until fragrant, about 1 minute. 
    Add ground meat and brown.
    Drain fat and add 2 tablespoons of the tomato paste, 
    mixing everything well together. 
    Continue cooking for a couple of minutes more. 
    Season with salt and pepper.
    Set aside.
    Make the béchamel sauce:*****
    In a pan over medium heat, melt butter, 
    add flour and whisk so no lumps form.
    Keep cooking the flour until it starts to bubble.
    Add the liquids gradually,
    one cup at a time whisking vigorously as the sauce will thicken.
    When it is bubbly and thick,
    turn off the heat, 
    season with salt and pepper and let it cool down.
    Assemble the dish and bake:
    Preheat your oven to 350F.
    Add the remaining 2 Tablespoons of tomato paste to 
    the pasta and about half a cup of 
    the béchamel sauce and mix well.
    In a 9x13 oven dish, spread another 1/2 cup of the
    béchamel sauce evenly at the bottom.
    Spread half the pasta ,
    then layer the entire meat mixture over the pasta.
    Top that with the remaining half of the pasta and level.
    Crack an egg over the remaining béchamel sauce and whisk well.
    Pour the béchamel over the pasta and spread evenly.
    Bake in oven for almost 45 minutes or until it is golden brown.
    Let it cool down, cut and serve.

    Step 1: Pound the Chicken
    Place the chicken breasts in a 1-gallon freezer bag and pound 
    to an even ½-inch thickness.
    This both tenderizes the meat and ensures even cooking.
    Left in their natural shape, 
    the thin side of the fillet dries out while the
    thicker side finishes cooking.
    If you don’t have a meat mallet,
    a rolling pin or a saucepan will both work well.
    The best tool for zesting citrus is a fine or microplane grater. 
    Simply rub the lemon in one direction against the blades, 
    turning the lemon as you go. Be sure to remove only the yellow part;
    the white pith underneath is bitter.

    Once you’ve zested the lemon, 
    mix all of the marinade ingredients except for the chicken together in 
    a 1-gallon zip-lock bag
    (go ahead and use the same one you used
    for pounding if it is still in good shape).
    Step 2: Make the Marinade
    Lemon is a key ingredient in this marinade, but I only use the zest.
    Contrary to conventional wisdom, 
    acidic ingredients (such as vinegar or lemon juice)
    do not tenderize lean boneless chicken breasts.
    Just the opposite: they “cook” the exterior of 
    the meat and give it a leathery texture. 
    The zest gives the chicken ample lemon flavor, 
    without affecting the chicken’s succulent texture.
    The best tool for zesting citrus is a fine or microplane grater.
    Simply rub the lemon in one direction against the blades, 
    turning the lemon as you go. Be sure to remove only the yellow part; 
    the white pith underneath is bitter.

    Once you’ve zested the lemon,
    mix all of the marinade ingredients except for the chicken together 
    in a 1-gallon zip-lock bag 
    (go ahead and use the same one you used for pounding if it is 
    still in good shape).
    Add the chicken breasts to the bag and massage the marinade into the
    meat until evenly coated.
    Step 3: Marinate
    Seal the bag and place in a bowl in the refrigerator
    (the bowl protects against leakage);
    let the chicken marinate for at least 4 hours or overnight.

    Step 4: Grill
    When you’re ready to eat,
    preheat your grill to high heat and oil the grates 
    (clean, oiled grates will give you the best grill marks).
    Be sure your grill is very hot before cooking the chicken;
    you want nice grill marks and char in the short 
    amount of time it takes to cook these.
    When pounded thin, chicken breasts only 
    need 2 to 3 minutes per side…no more!
    If you try to flip the chicken and it feels stuck, 
    try giving it 30 seconds. 
    It’ll release naturally when it’s ready.

    You’ll notice that the recipe calls for the grill
    to be covered while the chicken is cooking.
    This creates convection heat which helps give
    the chicken a nicely charred exterior
    and a tender,moist interior.

    After removing the chicken from the grill, 
    let it rest for 3 to 4 minutes before cutting into it.
    This will help keep the juices in and retain the meat’s moisture. 
    (The timing is perfect as it’s just enough to get it onto plates,
    add sides, and put on the table).

    While this chicken is best right off the grill, 
    it’s also the kind of thing you can make a double batch of
    and freeze for future use in salads,
    pastas, and sandwiches.

    6 minutes on each side,

        Directions:
        1. If you use fresh grape leaves, rinse them,
        and boil water on high heat while you have
        a bowl with iced water, 
        blanch the leaves for a second or
        two and place quickly in the cold 
        water to have a good green color.
        2. Start making the rice stuffing,
        place a pan over medium high heat, 
        add the oil and the onions, stir till golden.
